# swlineup

Spare-time project with the intention to make it easier for warlords of Runes of Magic guilds to plan their SW strategy.

This small interactive program offers one to create and manage his team and line them up on the field by using a number (similar to football).
Players can be given a class and a role, as well being moved around the map.

The project is a bit buggy if run from Eclipse, the code needs a lot of refactoring.
I am no longer working on it though, it is just here for showcase or if someone wants to use for his own purposes.

The .jar file does work properly: Simply run SWLineUpV1.3.jar but make sure that the flags directory is in the same directory as the executable.

Features:
- Create team
- Add players to team (name, number, class, country)
- Load/Save teams
- Show players in teamlist
- Show players on field
- Add players to field
- Divide roles on field
- Change fonts (project was compiled on Linux, the standard font shows well for Linux, the other font is more suitable for Windows)

If you want to share your line-up you have to make a screenshot or show per teamviewer.
